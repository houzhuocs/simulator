## Code and Data: Reproducing Fossilized Structural Color from Amber-entombed Wasp Using NS-FDTD Algorithm

The repository includes FDTDsimulator of multilayer film reflectors and scattering data under rough multilayer film conditions.

## Description of the data and Code/Software

1.  ***[simulator-main]***

    This simulator runs on Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 and includes three models: Mie scattering, smooth multilayer film reflectors, and rough multilayer film reflectors. It utilizes plane waves for full-wave and full-angle simulations of the scattering model.
2.  ***[amber_data_with_noise.zip]***

    This data represents the results of simulating the scattering of a plane wave irradiating a fossilized wasp using an FDTD simulator on a rough multi-layer film reflector. The wavelength range is from 400 nm to 700 nm, with incident angles varying from perpendicular to parallel incidence. The capture range for the reflection angle is from 0 to 180 degrees.
